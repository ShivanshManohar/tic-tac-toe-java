ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe in Java

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built in Java using basic arrays and condition checks.
This project is designed as a DSA mini-project for beginners to understand:

2D arrays in Java

Input validation

Game loop design

Win/draw detection logic

âœ¨ Features

âœ… Two-player game (Player X and Player O)
âœ… 3x3 grid with row/column input
âœ… Input validation â†’ prevents out-of-range or invalid moves
âœ… Detects wins (rows, columns, diagonals)
âœ… Detects draw when board is full
âœ… Simple console-based UI
